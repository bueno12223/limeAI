This is a high-stakes technical interview for an AI Scribe Notes Management Tool within a home healthcare compliance suite. Your goal is not just to build functionality, but to make the candidate (me) stand out by delivering premium, production-grade code. Focus on a "vertical slice" of excellence: every feature requested must be implemented with flawless architecture, strict maintainability, and zero technical debt. Mediocre or incomplete solutions are prohibited. The priority is quality over quantity, ensuring the code demonstrates senior-level mastery of the stack (Next.js, React, Prisma, PostgreSQL, AI APIs).
